# Dotfiles
This repo contains all my basic configuration files that I use when
booting on a new computer.

## Installation

### Tmux
- Copy *.tmux.conf* to ~/ and source the file
- Copy *tmux-sessionizer* to your bin folder (see: https://youtu.be/bdumjiHabhQ?t=267 to see what it does)
- In a tmux session press `ctrl+x I` to install the plugins

### Nvim
- Need to rewrite this

### zsh
- Just copy *.zshrc* to ~/ and source it
